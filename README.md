# NUMBER-THEORY-ALGORITHMS
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS SOME BASIC ALGORITHMS RELATED TO NUMBER THEORY LIKE THE DECOMPOSTION OF AN INTEGER IN PRIME FACTORS, CALCULATION OF PRIME NUMBERS AND THE EUCLIDEAN/DIVISION ALGORITHM TO FIND THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF TWO INTEGERS, CALCULATION OF CONTINUED FRACTIONS, CALCULATION OF THE P-ADIC EXPANSION OF INTEGERS AND RATIONAL NUMBERS. FURTHER ALGORITHMS WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE.

ANY SUGGESTION OR CONTRIBUTION IS ENTIRELY WELLCOME.


OBSERVATION: THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QUADRATIC SIEVE HERE PROVIDED ISN'T OPTIMIZED, BUT IT ILLUSTRATE WELL THE MAIN STEPS OF THE ALGORITHM. THE MOST EFFICIENT CLASSICAL ALGORITHMS TO COMPUTE THE FACTORS OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER ARE THE GENERAL NUMBER FIELD SIEVE AND ITS VARIANTS KNOWN AS SPECIAL NUMBER FIELD SIEVE. THESE KIND OF ALGORITHM FOLLOW AN IDEA SIMILAR TO THE QUADRATIC SIEVE, BUT THEY DO SIEVING ON ALGEBRAIC NUMBER FIELDS AND ARE SUITABLE ONLY FOR VERY LARGE INTEGERS ABOVE ONE HUNDRED DECIMAL DIGITS. THERE'S SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE ALGORITHMS IN LANGUAGES LIKE C/C++ EASILY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

FOR THE REASON OF COMPLEXITY WE HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED YET THE ECPP (ELLIPTIC CURVE) PRIMALITY TEST AND THE APR-CL PRIMALITY TEST (WHICH USE ARITHMETIC ON CYCLOTOMIC FIELDS). THEY ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT PRIMALITY TESTS IN USE AVAILABLE TODAY (THEY HAVE BETTER RUNTIME THAN THE AKS TEST). GOOD IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE.
