# NUMBER-THEORY-ALGORITHMS
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS SOME BASIC ALGORITHMS RELATED TO NUMBER THEORY LIKE THE DECOMPOSTION OF AN INTEGER IN PRIME FACTORS, CALCULATION OF PRIME NUMBERS AND THE EUCLIDEAN/DIVISION ALGORITHM TO FIND THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF TWO INTEGERS, CALCULATION OF CONTINUED FRACTIONS, CALCULATION OF THE P-ADIC EXPANSION OF INTEGERS AND RATIONAL NUMBERS. FURTHER ALGORITHMS WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE.

ANY SUGGESTION OR CONTRIBUTION IS ENTIRELY WELLCOME.

OBSERVATION: THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QUADRATIC SIEVE HERE PROVIDED ISN'T OPTIMIZED, BUT IT ILLUSTRATE WELL THE MAIN STEPS OF THE ALGORITHM. MANY OPTMIZATIONS LIKE THE BLOCK LANCZOS ALGORITHM FOR THE LINEAR ALGEBRA PART AND MULTITHREADING IN THE SIEVING PART ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED.

THE MOST EFFICIENT CLASSICAL ALGORITHMS TO COMPUTE THE FACTORS OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER ARE THE GENERAL NUMBER FIELD SIEVE AND ITS VARIANTS KNOWN AS SPECIAL NUMBER FIELD SIEVE. THESE KIND OF ALGORITHM FOLLOW AN IDEA SIMILAR TO THE QUADRATIC SIEVE, BUT THEY DO SIEVING ON ALGEBRAIC NUMBER FIELDS AND ARE SUITABLE ONLY FOR VERY LARGE INTEGERS ABOVE ONE HUNDRED DECIMAL DIGITS. THE IMPLEMENTATION HERE PROVIDED WAS NOT TESTED IN ITS ENTIRITY, BUT INDIVDUAL PARTS ARE WORKING FINE. THIS WAS DONE FOR PEDADGOGICAL AND LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY (I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL MATHEMATICIAN). 

THERE'S SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THESE ALGORITHMS IN LANGUAGES LIKE C/C++ EASILY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET. ONE SHOULD USE ONE OF THESE BATTLE TESTED AND ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS AND RELATED STUFF.

FOR THE REASON OF COMPLEXITY WE HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED YET THE ECPP (ELLIPTIC CURVE) PRIMALITY TEST AND THE APR-CL PRIMALITY TEST (WHICH USE ARITHMETIC ON CYCLOTOMIC FIELDS). THEY ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT PRIMALITY TESTS IN USE AVAILABLE TODAY (THEY HAVE BETTER RUNTIME THAN THE AKS TEST). GOOD IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE. SEE FOR INSTANCE: https://github.com/wacchoz/APR_CL/blob/master/APR_CL.py AND  https://github.com/onechip/ecpp

DUE TO ITS COMPLEXITY WE SHALL NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NUMBER FIELD SIEVE AND THE ALGEBRAIC FUNCTION FIELD SIEVE FOR THE DISCRETE LOGARITHM PROBLEM.
